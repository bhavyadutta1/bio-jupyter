    "Continuous culture is a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) employed for the continuous production of microbial biomass, based on the continuous addition of sterilized nutrient medium and the elution of the culture fluid at the same steady flow rate in the bioreactor. It's a cultural process in which the cell population grows at a constant concentration and volume, meaning that cells' growth rate is maintained in the exponential phase: this process is defined as ' steady-state of growth'.\n",

    "A commonly used continuous culture method is the chemostat: a fermenter in which the cell density is kept constant by keeping the dilution rate and flow rate of nutrient medium constant. The sterile nutrient medium is added into the reservoir along with the microbial cells. Substrate is continuously added into the reservoir, and the by-products are continuously eluted allowing the  cells to grow at a constant rate (exponential phase) as there will be no nutrient depletion due to continuous nutrient supply into the reservoir.\n",
    "Growth rate is determined by the rate at which the new medium is fed into the reservoir, while dilution rate controls the substrate concentration \n",

The Monod model is the most common mathematical model that describes the relationship between growth rate and the concentration of a single growth-controlling substrate through the maximum specific growth rate (μmax), and the substrate affinity constant (Ks). This model shows that biomass grows in proportion to the substrate consumption, expressed by the following formula:"
