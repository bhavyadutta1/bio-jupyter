Code cells have square brackets on the top left. These square brackets are filled with a number indicating the sequence of evaluations.\n",

    " 1. Use the function input(), read the [Documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp) for help.\n",
    " 2. Split string into list with the function [split](https://www.askpython.com/python/string/python-string-split-function) (`name.split()`) and save it in a variable (`name_list`)\n",
    " 3. Store the surname (`name_list[-1]`) in a new variable (`surname`).\n",
    " 3. Count the length of the surname (`myLen = len(surname)`).\n",
    " 4. Print the surname each letter a line in reverse order:\n",
    "    - Construct a `for` loop which decreases from the length of the surname to 0 (use `range(myLen,...,...)`, [help]()). Remember that Python starts counting from zero: the surname indices are: 0 to myLen-1.\n",
    "    - Print the letter in `surname` with the counter of the `for`-loop.\n",

    "### C: Exercise for Python advanced\n",
    "Write a script that uses prompt input of a DNA sequence and generates the complement DNA sequence, e.g., AAGGCCTT->TTCCGGAA.\n",
    " 1. Define a dictionary with the base-complement mapping.\n",
    " 2. Get sequence input from prompt and replace bases via list comprehension. Correct lower- to upper-case letters.\n",
    " 3. Print the result and save it as csv-file if the user provides a file name."
