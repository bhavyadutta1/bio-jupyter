## Get Started
To make it easy to get started with GitHub, here's a list of recommended next steps.

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

### Clone the repository
There are several ways to access the project files:

1) The repository can be cloned to your local pc. Simply, go to the folder inside your pc where you want to copy the repository.
Open cmd line and run
```
git clone https://github.com/bhavyadutta1/bio-jupyter.git
```
Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```
2) The zip file for whole project can also be downloaded.

- The **'master'** branch is the main branch where all the files are stored. All the development is done in this branch. New branches might be created to develop a new feature in the notebooks. In this case, the new branch is used to do all the development without affecting the master branch. After all the modifications, all the new branches will be merged back to the **'master'**.

- The commits are similar to checkpoints. Whenever a file is modified and saved, a commit is created. We can jump to any old commits to check that version of the file.
